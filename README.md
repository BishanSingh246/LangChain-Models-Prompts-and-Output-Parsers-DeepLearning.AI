<br>
</h1>

## Description
In this repository, we can learn about models, prompts, and output parsers (Langchain).
<br>

Reference - <a href='https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/2/models,-prompts-and-parsers'>LangChain: Models, Prompts and Output Parsers DeepLearning.AI</a>

## Instruction
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Set it up on your local machine and open ```Model_prompt_parser.ipynb``` file with Vscode or Notebook

2. Generate Api key from <a href='https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys'>OpenAI</a>. 

 
## Running the Application
To run the application, you have two options:

1. Run a single block: You can execute each code block individually by running them one by one.

2. Run all blocks at once: Alternatively, you can choose to run all the code blocks together in one go.

Before running the application, make sure to paste your OpenAI API key into the second code block in the ```Model_prompt_parser.ipynb``` file.
